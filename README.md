git checkout -b <branch_name>
or
git branch <branch_name>
```

To __Checkout to different Branch / Switch Branch__ : 
```sh
git checkout <your_branch_name>
or
git switch <your_branch_name>
```

To __List All Branches__ : 
```sh
git branch (Lists all local branches).
git branch -r (Lists all remote branches).
git branch -a (Lists both local and remote branches).
```

To __Fetch/Pull all Branches from Remote__ :

git fetch origin  (Fetches all changes from the remote repository).
git pull origin <branch_name> (Pulls the specified remote branch into your local branch).
```

```

To __View Branch History__ : 
```sh
git log   (To display All details)
git log <branch_name>  (Shows the commit history of a specific branch).
git log --graph --oneline --all  (Displays a graph of the commit histories).
```

#### Stash Related
Git stash is a command that allows you to temporarily save and set aside changes in your working directory without committing them.

To __Stash your changes__ : 
```sh
git stash       (To keep aside your modified changes)
git stash -u    (To keep aside your untracked + modified changes)
git stash save "Description" (Stash your changes with specific description)
```

To __List your Stash__ : 
```sh
git stash list
```

To __Apply your Stash Changes to Working Directory__ : (This won't remove your stash from stash list)
```sh
git stash apply  (Applies most recent Stash)
git stash apply n  ((n is specific stash number) Applies particular Stash changes).
```

To __Apply your Stash Changes to Working Directory__ : (This will remove your stash from stash list after applying)
```sh
git stash pop  (Applies most recent Stash)
git stash pop n  ((n is specific stash number) Applies particular Stash changes).
```

To __Delete Stash__ : (This will remove your stash from stash list)
```sh
git stash drop  (Deletes most recent Stash)
git stash drop n  ((n is specific stash number) Deletes particular Stash).
git stash clear  (Removes all stash from List)
```

To __Create a Branch From Stash__ : (This will create new branch with stash changes)
```sh
git stash branch <branch_name> (Creates from latest Stash)
git stash branch <branch_name> Stash n ((n is specific stash number) Creates from mentioned Stash)
```
